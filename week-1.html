                    <span class="bold">Team Mesrobian</span> hit the RB mother load this week.
                    Kareem Hunt put up a dominant 45.6 fantasy points,
                    all but assuring her the win as he went for 146 rushing
                    yards, 98 receiving yards, and 3 TDs against the Patriots.
                    Antonio Brown was Antonio Brown and gave her 29.2
                    fantasy points, netting her the highest score in the leage
                    this week and leading to a decisive victory, despite her
                    opponent (<span class="bold">Gronk if you Like my Booty!</span>) scoring the second highest
                    number of points in the league (128.9)
                  </p>

                  <p><i class="ion-ios-americanfootball"></i>
                    <span class="bold">Team Emberg</span>'s decision to draft Tom Brady in the second round
                    looked costly, as Brady completed fewer than 50% of his passes
                    and put up 0 touchdowns for an uncharacteristic 10.7 fantasy points.
                    But it's TB12! He'll bounce back.

                    <span class="bold">Team Sisson</span> won by a solid 20 points; this matchup would've been
                    a lot closer if not for <span class="bold">Memes are Life</span>'s odd choice to play
                    both Darren McFadden and Odell Beckham Jr. Neither player played
                    in his respective game, netting <span class="bold">Memes are Life</span> zero points apiece.

                    The closest game of the week was between <span class="bold">Bill Belichick's Sweater
                    Sleeves</span> and <span class="bold">My Team is Stacked-AF</span>, with the latter team edging out <thead>
                      win by .7 points (96.2-95.5)! Weirdly enough, <span class="bold">Bill Belichick's
                      Sweater Sleeves</span> would've had the win if she had NOT played a QB;
                      her QB, Andy Dalton, had a terrible game against the Baltimore Ravens
                      and earned her an atrocious -3 fantasy points.

                    One match next week is between two 0-1 teams, meaning
                    there's at least one team next week guaranteed to start

                    It's only the first week of football! While many of these
                    games were telling, it's also inadvisable to over-correct
                    and freak out based on numbers you're seeing from just
                    one week. Be cautious about trades and the waiver wire,
                    but feel free to make some moves based on performances from
                    players you saw and liked.

                    lost his #1 pick in the draft, David Johnson. Johnson suffered
                    a wrist injury that's projected to leave him out of the regular
                    season for as many as 12 weeks, effectively rendering his fantasy
                    season over. Conversely, Ezekiel Elliot's suspension is still
                    potentially overturned, meaning <span class="bold">Gronk if you Like my Booty!</span>'s
                    decision to pick him up in the later rounds of the draft could end up being <thead>
