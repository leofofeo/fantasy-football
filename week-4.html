                     The craziest matchup this week came down to the wire, with <span class="bold">Team Koeller</span> leading <span class="bold">My team is Stacked-AF</span> by a little over 1 point and 4 seconds left in the final game of the week.
                     She would've sealed the win, except: with four seconds left on the clock, the Redskins were down to the Chiefs by 3 points. Attempting a series of lateral passes to make it to the endzone, the Redskins
                     fumbled the ball. It was recovered by the Chief's Justin Houston who, instead of simply taking a knee or running out of bounds to end the game, ran it back for a touchdown. This gave <span class="bold">My team is Stacked-AF</span> (who owns the Chief's D/ST unit)
                     a final six fantasy points as the last game of the week closed out, putting him up by 5 points and securing the win. CRAZY!

                           <span class="bold">Team Sisson</span> made a smart move early in the season by picking up Alex Smith as her backup QB. The dude's been killer on the field and in fantasy points, and I can't really think of anyone aside from Rodgers and Brady who's been
                           as reliably consistent.
